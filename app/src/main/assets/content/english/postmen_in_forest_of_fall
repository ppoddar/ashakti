<h3>Postmen in Forest of Fall</h3>
<br>
Seen many postmen wander in the forest of Fall<br>
Their yellow bags filled like bovine bellies<br>
Picked up letters of yore, old and new <br>
Those men in the forest of fall<br><br>
  

Seen them ceaseless<br>
As egrets fish<br>
Mysterious, alert, agile<br><br>
Not like postmen of our days<br>
Not like hands that lost letters of our luxurious love<br><br>

We are drifting apart<br>
Going afar for lure of letters<br>
Getting more letters from far<br>
Going away from you yesterday <br>
To post letters of love today<br>
Thus we drift away from our kin<br>
Reveal our foolish weakness and greed<br><br>

We no more reflect in a mirror<br>
We float away in the loneliness of our balconies <br>
We float away bare in moonshine<br>
Long have we not held each other in our arms<br>
Long have we not kissed each other<br>
Long have we not heard other sing<br>
Long have we not seen a carefree kid<br>
We walk towards a forest older than the woods<br>
Where the leaves left their eternal marks on the rocks<br>
We are heading to a world void of contact <br><br>

Seen many postmen in the forest of Fall<br>
Their yellow bags filled like bovine bellies<br>
Picked up old letters anew <br>
Those men in the forest of Fall<br><br>
  
A letter drifts away from a letter<br>
Never seen a tree moving away from a tree.
