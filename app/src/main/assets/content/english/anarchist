<h3>Anarchist</h3>

Deep rumblings ashore <br>
<it>"Whose corpse floats on the river? <br>
Where was his home?"</it><br>
Night waves only rumble: <br>
</it>"It's I, the anarchist"</it>.<br>
<p>
Does ocean embrace living and the dead<br>
Both so dear?<br>
<p>
Who knows if poison is the right drink, <br>
Elixir is poison?<br>
Intellect tires day and night.<br>
<p>
Deep rumblings ashore <br>
<it>"Whose corpse floats on the river? <br>
Where was his home?"</it><br>
Night waves only rumble: <br>
<it>"It's I, the anarchist".</it><br>
