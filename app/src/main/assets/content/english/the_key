<h3>The key</h3>
<br>
Still kept your favorite key<br>
The one that was lost?<br>
How do you open the vault now?<br>
<p>
Still have that spot on your chin?<br>
Sudden urge to write<br>
Before journey begins to a new land<br>
<p>
Kept the key with utmost care<br>
For all these years<br>
<em>"Do you want it back?<br>
Please let me know."</em><br><br>

Your luminous face<br>
Awash with tears<br>
In memories' attic<br>
<em>"Do you want it back?<br>
Please let me know."</em>
